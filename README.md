This application will display a clock which will alert with short "blips" on the 15, 30, 45, 55-59 seconds of every minute, and then a longer "bleep" on the 00 second.  It is intended to assist the user in watching day-trading data in real-time, by training their brain to recognize any patterns which may occur at these points of time.

The size of the application is selectable between 3 sizes (small, medium, and large).  The color of the clock and the timing bar are selectable between 5 colors.
